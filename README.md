# Color Analyzer/Extractor
## By James Hill
## Purpose:
### This Python script extracts the most common colors from an image and displays them using the Turtle module. It's a fun way to visualize the predominant hues in an image.

## How to Use
### Clone the Repository:
### Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

### Install Dependencies:
#### Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them via pip:

### Copy code
#### pip install colorgram.py
#### Run the Script:
#### Run the color_extractor.py script. You'll be prompted to provide the path of the target image and the number of colors to extract.

### Copy code
#### python color_extractor.py
#### Follow Instructions:
#### Follow the prompts to enter the image path and the number of colors you want to extract. The script will then display the selected hues against a neutral gray background.

### Copy Color List:
#### After the script prints the list of RGB colors to the terminal, copy the list. You'll need it to paste into the code later.

### Paste Color List:
#### Open the script in a text editor and paste the copied list into the appropriate place in the code where it says # copy the printed rgb_colors list. paste it into your program with the variable name you choose. ex: #### colors_to_use = [PASTE HERE]. Replace [PASTE HERE] with the copied list.

### Run the Script Again:
#### Run the script again after pasting the color list. This time, it will use the colors you provided.

### View Result:
#### The script will display the extracted colors using Turtle graphics. Each dot represents a color sampled from the image.

### Exit:
#### Click on the Turtle graphics window to exit the program.

### Dependencies
#### colorgram.py: This library is used to extract colors from images.
#### Turtle: The Turtle module is used for graphics to display the extracted colors.
### Note
#### Make sure the image path you provide is valid and accessible.
#### Depending on the number of colors you choose to extract, the process may take some time.
#### Feel free to experiment with different images and color extraction numbers to see how the visualization changes.
#### This README provides clear instructions for running the script and highlights the dependencies needed. It also offers some notes and tips for users to enhance their experience with the program.
